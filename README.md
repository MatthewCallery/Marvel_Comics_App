# Marvel Comics App
Android app containing two screens:
1. A list of all possible superheroes in the Marvel Multiverse (includes a search bar so users can search for a superhero by name)
2. A superhero detail page which includes a list of that hero's comics

The app is built using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), Android's modern declarative UI toolkit.

### Architecture
- MVVM architecture
- [Kotlin multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/) app, albeit one where only the Android app has been built
- Networking logic sits in the `shared` folder and could be reused by an iOS app
- Android specific code sits in the `androidApp` folder
- `iosApp` folder can be ignored

### App structure (and easiest way to review)
In the `androidApp` folder:
- `MainActivity` (manages the app's lifecycle and navigation)
- `CharacterListScreen` and `CharacterDetailScreen` contain the UI for the two screens
- `MarvelComicsViewModel` stores and manages UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way

In the `shared` business logic folder:
- `MarvelComicsRepository` manages collecting data and exposing that data to the rest of the app
- `MarvelComicsApi` fetches data from the Marvel API
- Data classes (models) inc. `MarvelCharacter`, `Comic` etc.

### Performance
Both screens use Jetpack Compose's `LazyColumn` component, which only composes and lays out items which are visible in the componentâ€™s viewport. It also lazily manages the fetching of images for visible characters or comics from the Marvel API.

#### Character List screen:
I've made a conscious decision to sacrifice a little in performance for a boost in usability.

The first time the app is opened, it fetches all of the characters from the Marvel API and caches them in a SQLite database on the user's device. Only strings are stored, so the storage required is negligible. The app will only refetch data from the Marvel API every 7 days (it's rare that they create a new character).

The advantage of this approach is that it enables offline use of the app and no further API calls are required when a user is searching for a particular superhero.

#### Character Detail screen:
The character's comics are fetched from the Marvel API each time a user clicks on a given character. It didn't make sense to locally store all of the comics for 2000+ characters.

### Tests
- Unit tests can be found in `androidApp/src/test` and `shared/src/commonTest`.
- UI tests are in `androidApp/src/androidTest`

### Dependency injection
The app uses the [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) Kotlin injection library.

### Animations
Simple `slideInHorizontally`/`slideOutHorizontally` animations for the screen transitions.

## Next steps given more time:
- Increase unit test coverage, particularly of the view model
- Add a loading animation or logo to the splash screen
- Build an iOS app using the `shared` business logic
